# MEAL TRACKER

The application, MEAL TRACKER, is an online personal fitness journal
where a user can input the foods they eat daily, as well as keep track of their body weight.
The user can create an account which allows them access to the main functions of the application
which will tie their specific meal and body data entries to their profile, which also tracks
their starting weight, height, and goal weight.
